        "description": " After using this bit in a drill press on wood with uneven hardness across the working surface, I ended up with a slight top-edge mess. I put the bit in a variable speed hand-held drill and carefully chewed out a beautiful 3/4 deep hole. On a different project, the bit did a great job on a piece of hardwood with even grain. Good choice for getting bored (sic)..",

        "description": " This was used to make cups in a flat game table accessory. The cups were 1 1/4 deep in red oak and were made using a small Wen table top drill press 1/3 hp 10 speed. I made 48 of these and the Amana still is fairly sharp and working well. These took some time (about 10 minutes each)because of relatively low power drill and very hard wood but they were consistent and created a very smooth finish..",
